# General Rules

## Documentation

Never add any new .md file for documenting anything.

# UI Guidelines

## Modal vs Alert

When a page has any popup option, use modal instead of `js-alert` (JavaScript alert dialogs).

**Why:** Modals provide better UX with custom styling, accessibility, and control over the interaction flow.

## Notifications

For notifications and user feedback, use a top-right toaster component instead of alerts.

**Implementation:**
- Display toaster notifications in the top-right corner of the viewport
- Use appropriate toast types: success, error, warning, info
- Auto-dismiss after appropriate duration (typically 3-5 seconds)
- Allow manual dismissal via close button
